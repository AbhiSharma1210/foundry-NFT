I chose to make this piece a massive black canvas with a single dot which can be read as a light at the end of a tunnel, or a single person standing in a dark space, a single star in the night sky and/or a single glimmer of hope.. I chose to make this specifically abstract because the concept of a ‘good future’ is broad and yet specific to each of us.",
